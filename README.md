# Team Project 1 ‚Äì Software Engineering

## üìå Overview
- This repository contains the submission for **Team Project 1**.  
- The project builds on provided foundational code and enhances it with new functionality, input validation, updated documentation, and testing.  
- The goal is to simulate working in a **high-performance software engineering team**, addressing real-world issues such as collaboration, code integration, input validation, testing, and professional documentation.

## üìÇ Repository Contents
The repository is organized as follows:

- **/src/**  
  Contains the application source code, updated from the foundational code.  
  Code has been refactored, validated, and documented to ensure readability and maintainability.  

- **/docs/**  
  - UML diagrams (architecture + detailed design)  
  - Updated documentation aligned with the codebase  
  - Team Norms and other supporting documents  

- **/tests/**  
  Contains automated tests developed for this phase of the project.  
  Includes test descriptions, purposes, and results.  

- **/recordings/**  
  - Stand-up meeting recordings (at least two per week)  
  - Screencasts (functional demo + technical explanation)  

- **README.md**  
  This file. Provides instructions for navigating the repository.  

- **Submission.pdf**  
  Final submission document (produced from the provided template).

## üé• Screencasts
Two screencasts have been produced and uploaded to this repository:

1. **Technical Screencast**  
   Explains the codebase, structure, and how requirements flow from architecture ‚Üí design ‚Üí code ‚Üí tests.  

2. **Functional Screencast**  
   Demonstrates the execution of the application and how each user requirement is satisfied.  

Each team member participates equally in presenting the screencasts.

## üë• Team Collaboration
- The team met at least **twice weekly** for stand-up meetings (recordings included).  
- Each stand-up followed the 3-part format:  
  1. What was accomplished  
  2. What will be done next  
  3. Any blocking issues  

- **Team Norms** were established and signed to ensure accountability, communication, and quality work.
